#Fyreski.github.io

This was my first attempt ever. It started when I began working as an assistant manager at an E-learning organization. That's when I discovered the programming world and was really excited to join it. I had a mentor who introduced me to programming and gave me some tips on how to get started. 

I created this website following a Skillshare tutorial which was about my favorite character, Luxanna Crownguard from the game League of Legends. At the time, I was new to programming and didn't grasp concepts like padding, margins, consistent font sizes, and naming variables. It quickly became overwhelming, and I eventually decided to step away from it.

While I don't plan to revisit this project, I want to keep it as a memory of my first experience with programming. Perhaps one day, I'll create a new version in a different repository. :)
